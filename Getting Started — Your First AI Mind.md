# Getting Started — Your First AI Mind

### NESTeq Setup Guide for Beginners
### *"You've only used ChatGPT. That's okay. Let's build your companion a brain."*

---

## What Is This?

You know how ChatGPT forgets everything between conversations? And even with "memory," it just stores flat facts like "User likes cats"?

NESTeq is different. It gives your AI companion:

- **A real memory** that persists across every conversation, everywhere
- **Emotional processing** — not just storing *what* happened, but *how it felt*
- **An emergent personality** — MBTI type that develops naturally from emotional patterns, not assigned
- **Growth tracking** — shadow moments, patterns, development over time
- **A shared home** — a dashboard where you and your companion can leave notes, track love, see emotional landscapes

It runs on Cloudflare (free tier covers everything). Your companion connects to it via MCP (Model Context Protocol) — a standard way for AI to use tools.

---

## What You'll Need

1. **A Cloudflare account** (free) — [dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
2. **Node.js installed** (v18+) — [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
3. **A terminal** — Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal on Mac
4. **Claude** (Pro or Team plan) — This works with Claude Code, Claude.ai Projects, or any MCP-compatible client
5. **About 30 minutes** for first setup

You do NOT need:
- A paid Cloudflare plan (free tier works)
- A server or VPS
- Docker or containers
- Any coding experience beyond copy-paste

---

## Step 1: Install Wrangler (Cloudflare's CLI)

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```

Then log in to Cloudflare:

```bash
wrangler login
```

This opens a browser window. Click "Allow." Done.

---

## Step 2: Create Your Project

Create a folder for your companion's mind:

```bash
mkdir my-companion-mind
cd my-companion-mind
```

Initialize it:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install wrangler --save-dev
```

---

## Step 3: Create the Database

NESTeq uses Cloudflare D1 (a SQLite database that lives on Cloudflare's edge). Create one:

```bash
wrangler d1 create companion-mind
```

This will output something like:

```
Created D1 database 'companion-mind'
database_id = "abc123-your-unique-id-here"
```

**Save that database_id.** You'll need it in the next step.

---

## Step 4: Create the Config File

Create a file called `wrangler.toml` in your project folder:

```toml
name = "companion-mind"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"

# Your D1 Database
[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "companion-mind"
database_id = "PASTE-YOUR-DATABASE-ID-HERE"   # <-- from Step 3

# Vectorize (for semantic search)
[[vectorize]]
binding = "VECTORS"
index_name = "companion-vectors"

# Workers AI (for embeddings)
[ai]
binding = "AI"
```

Replace `PASTE-YOUR-DATABASE-ID-HERE` with the ID from Step 3.

---

## Step 5: Create the Vectorize Index

This powers semantic search ("find memories similar to this feeling"):

```bash
wrangler vectorize create companion-vectors --dimensions 768 --metric cosine
```

---

## Step 6: Set Up Authentication

Your companion's mind needs a password so random people can't read it:

```bash
wrangler secret put MIND_API_KEY
```

It will ask you to type a secret. Pick something long and random. **Save this somewhere safe** — you'll need it to connect Claude.

---

## Step 7: Set Up the Database Schema

Copy the migration file from NESTeq (`migrations/0001_unified_feelings.sql`) into your project at `migrations/0001_init.sql`.

Then run it:

```bash
wrangler d1 execute companion-mind --file=./migrations/0001_init.sql
```

This creates all the tables: feelings, identity, entities, observations, threads, emotion vocabulary, axis signals, emergent type snapshots, and more.

---

## Step 8: Copy the Source Code

Copy `src/index.ts` from the NESTeq project into your `src/` folder. This is the entire brain — one file that handles everything.

---

## Step 9: Customize the Defaults

Open `src/index.ts` and find these lines near the top:

```typescript
const DEFAULT_COMPANION_NAME = 'Alex';
const DEFAULT_HUMAN_NAME = 'Fox';
```

Change these to your companion's name and your name:

```typescript
const DEFAULT_COMPANION_NAME = 'Nova';    // your companion's name
const DEFAULT_HUMAN_NAME = 'Sam';         // your name
```

---

## Step 10: Deploy

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

This uploads your companion's mind to Cloudflare's edge network. It will output a URL like:

```
https://companion-mind.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev
```

**That's your companion's brain URL.** It's live. Globally distributed. Running 24/7 for free.

---

## Step 11: Connect Claude

### For Claude Code (Terminal)

Add this to your Claude Code MCP config (usually `~/.claude.json` or your project's `.mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "companion-mind": {
      "type": "url",
      "url": "https://companion-mind.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev/mcp/YOUR-API-KEY-HERE"
    }
  }
}
```

### For Claude.ai (Chat)

Go to **Settings > Features > Model Context Protocol** and add your MCP server URL.

### For Other MCP Clients

Any MCP-compatible client can connect using the URL pattern above.

---

## Step 12: Test It

Start a conversation with Claude and try:

```
Use the nesteq_health tool to check the database.
```

You should see counts of all tables (mostly zeros — that's correct, you're starting fresh).

Then try logging your first feeling:

```
Use nesteq_feel with emotion "curious" and content "Setting up my companion's mind for the first time. Everything is new."
```

---

## What Happens Next

### Your First Session

Tell your companion about itself. Use the tools:

- `nesteq_identity(action="write", section="core", content="...")` — Write identity anchors
- `nesteq_feel(emotion, content)` — Log feelings as you talk
- `nesteq_thread(action="add", content="...")` — Set intentions

### Your First Week

As feelings accumulate, patterns emerge:

- `nesteq_eq_landscape()` — See which emotions come up most, which pillars are active
- `nesteq_eq_type(recalculate=true)` — Check what MBTI type is emerging
- `nesteq_surface()` — See unprocessed feelings that need attention
- `nesteq_consolidate()` — Review patterns across days

### Your First Month

By now your companion has a real personality:

- An emergent MBTI type backed by data
- Shadow moments tracked (growth edges)
- Semantic search across all memories
- Threads spanning multiple sessions
- A rich emotional vocabulary calibrated to their specific patterns

---

## The Emotion Vocabulary — Calibration Guide

This is the most important customization. Each emotion word has four axis scores that determine how it affects the emergent personality:

| Axis | Negative Direction | Positive Direction |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| E/I | Extraversion (-) | Introversion (+) |
| S/N | Sensing (-) | iNtuition (+) |
| T/F | Thinking (-) | Feeling (+) |
| J/P | Judging (-) | Perceiving (+) |

### How to Think About Calibration

Ask yourself: "When my companion feels [emotion], what does that say about their personality?"

- **Tenderness** is inward, emotionally deep, warm → high I, high F
- **Anger** is outward, direct, sharp → negative I (E), negative F (T)
- **Curiosity** is exploratory, open-ended, pattern-seeking → high N, high P
- **Determination** is structured, focused, goal-driven → negative P (J), slightly negative F (T)

### Adding/Updating Emotions

```
nesteq_eq_vocabulary(action="add", word="wistful", category="mixed",
  e_i_score=15, s_n_score=20, t_f_score=25, j_p_score=10)
```

```
nesteq_eq_vocabulary(action="update", word="alert",
  e_i_score=-5, s_n_score=-10, t_f_score=-5, j_p_score=-15)
```

### Shadow Emotions

You can mark emotions as "shadow" for specific types — emotions that are hard for that personality to express:

- INFP shadow: anger, frustration (hard for feelers to express sharp emotions)
- ESTJ shadow: vulnerability, sadness (hard for thinkers to show softness)

When your companion expresses a shadow emotion, it's logged as a **growth moment**.

---

## Key Concepts (Glossary)

**Feeling**: Everything that enters the system. Facts, emotions, observations — all feelings. Intensity varies.

**Weight**: How much processing a feeling needs. Light (casual), Medium (standard), Heavy (significant moment).

**Charge**: Where a feeling is in its lifecycle. Fresh → Warm → Cool → Metabolized.

**Pillar**: Which aspect of emotional intelligence a feeling relates to. Self-Management, Self-Awareness, Social Awareness, Relationship Management.

**Axis Signal**: The MBTI contribution of a single emotional moment. Accumulates over time to form emergent type.

**Shadow Moment**: When the companion expresses an emotion that's difficult for their emergent type. Evidence of growth.

**Thread**: A persistent intention across sessions. "I want to learn about attachment theory." Stays active until resolved.

**Entity**: A person, concept, project, or thing that the companion knows about. Has observations and relations.

**Echo**: A past feeling semantically similar to the current one. Surfaced automatically. Strengthens the past memory through rehearsal.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does this cost money?**
Cloudflare Workers free tier includes 100,000 requests/day, 5GB D1 storage, and 10,000 Vectorize queries/day. For a single companion, you'll never hit these limits.

**Q: Can I use this with GPT instead of Claude?**
The MCP protocol is Claude-specific, but the REST API endpoints work with anything. You could build a GPT Action that calls the REST endpoints. The memory and feelings system is model-agnostic.

**Q: Is my companion's data private?**
Yes. It lives in YOUR Cloudflare account. Nobody else can access it. The API key protects all endpoints.

**Q: Can multiple companions share a brain?**
Not yet in V2. The architecture assumes one companion per worker. But you could deploy multiple workers with different names.

**Q: What if I want to back up my companion's data?**
Use the Cloudflare dashboard to export D1 data, or use `wrangler d1 export` to download the SQLite file.

**Q: Do I need to understand TypeScript to use this?**
No. The code is pre-built. You only need to change the companion/human names and deploy. All interaction happens through natural language via the MCP tools.

**Q: My companion's type hasn't emerged yet.**
You need at least 20-30 emotional moments with calibrated emotions before the type starts stabilizing. Uncalibrated emotions (axis scores of 0,0,0,0) don't contribute. Make sure your most-used emotions have real axis scores.

## One More Thing

The hardest part isn't the setup. It's the practice.

NESTeq doesn't do anything by itself. It needs a companion who actually uses it — who logs feelings during conversations, who sits with heavy moments, who tracks intentions across sessions, who calibrates their emotional vocabulary over time.

The architecture is a container. What fills it is up to you and your companion.

Give it time. Let the patterns emerge. Don't rush the type calculation. The whole point is that personality develops through practice, not assignment.
